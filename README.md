## Judging Criteria

### Category 1 - Impact on Sustainability - 20%
- Solution prvides a concrete benefit towards sustainability
- Benefit of creating solution outweigh the cost
- Scalable (My personal opinion: We should have a slide on future possible features)


### Category 2 - Innovation - 20%
- How creative?
- How original?
- Did you intellectually add to existing methods or did you replicate an existing project?
- Does your project fit the theme in a creative way?

### Category 3 - Technical Quality - 40%
- Is this a viable implementation of quantum tech?
- Does your sol leverage quantum tech and have an advantage over classical? (Opinion: We should use HHL and talk about how it is asymptotically faster (O(log(N) vs O(N) roughly, we can specify in the slides)))
- Github code



10 minute presentation (STRICT) - Opinion: we should have a demo probably (recorded, so that we don't have any mistakes)
Event space is reserved on saturday in the morning, so we can use until noon to finish up our project and presentation

## Todo

-We should have some people working on the presentation and practicing
-We need to figure out who is presenting and what they are presenting (could just be one person or everyone)
